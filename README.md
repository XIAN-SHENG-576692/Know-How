# Know-How Repository

This repository is a personal knowledge base to store **my know-how** for quick reference and long-term preservation.  
It aims to solve problems that daily notes alone cannot address.

## Purpose

1. **Easy Access**
    - Prevent knowledge from being lost.

    - Minimize reading time.
    - Ensure content is easy to share.
        
4. **Traceability**
    - Record important context for each piece of knowledge:
        - Who contributed the idea
        - Why it was done this way
        - Background or less important details
        - When and why it was last updated
            
5. **Scalability**
    - Structure and content should grow without losing clarity.
    - Avoid over-complication to ensure long-term usability.
